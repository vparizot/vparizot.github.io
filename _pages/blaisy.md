This past winter break, my brother (Max) and I went to Blaisy Bas for the first time in about a decade. Blaisy Bas is a tiny tiny town outside Dijon, France where my dad grew up. It's the kind of town that has one bakery and one general store, and you can bike through in under 5 minutes. My brothers and I spent a lot of summers there when we were younger -- helping my aunt with her farm, biking on the rundown motorcross, and hanging out with the other 7 kids in town.
