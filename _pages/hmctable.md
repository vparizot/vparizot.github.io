 The Dimensions and Process for Building a Good WeCo Table

My friends and I made a WeCo table with the notel motel design. If you're thinking of making a good courtyard table, here is the list & dimensions of wood you would need:

| Item                 | Quantity | Purpose                            |
| :----------------    | :------: | ----:                              |
|  4x8' plank          |     1    | table top                          |
|  4x4 of length 37”   |     6    | legs                               |
|  2x4 of length 96”   |     4    | upper side supports, longways      |
|  2x4 of length 93”   |     2    | lower nner side supports, longways |
|  2x4 of length 48”   |     2    | side supports, stubby way          |
|  2x4 of length 45”   |     5    |inside under table supports, stubby way |
|  6x1” of length 36”  |     2    |shelves, stubby way                 |
|  6x1 of length 33.5” |     4    |shelves, 2 per each side of longways|

We put it all together with 2" TORX wood screws. The TORX wood screws help prevent stripping the screws. When we replaced all the tops of the table after over a year, the TORX screws were easy to take out.

The shelves can be any dimensions, so it's worth seeing what scraps are left in the wood shop.

The 6 legged design and 2x4 reinforcements under the table top really helps to make it safe for hhp, and other events.

Our table came together to look like this:

Here are some pictures of our table and the other tables in the courtyard getting used.
