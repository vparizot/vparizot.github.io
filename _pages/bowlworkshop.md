This past weekend I led a bowl workshop at the HMC machine shop, where I helped 2 people make tiny wooden bowls. Before the workshop I got to practice sharpening the HSS tools.

I wrote up a process router, which you can check out [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ftSUGuWtLZVY-wh4F2nWqQzCsNNEdEMn7snpYEdamEM/edit?usp=sharing)

After the workshop I stayed and made my own bowl! I made it two sided, with a bowl on one side and a ring holder on the other.
